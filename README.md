# veneer-image-pair-matching
A script for matching veneer images using segmentation and Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) -features. The matching algorithm has been tested with 2579 image pair dataset achieving 99.41% accuracy

The full dataset is available at IEEE Dataport / doi: https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/vq7x-q108

1) Download images (10 example pairs or up to 2579 from the link above)
2) Edit the folder settings in scripts (folder locations, etc.) as approriate and run
3) Veneer21_READ_and_MATCH_images.py
4) Veneer21_ANALYZE_Stats.py
